# Cynax Cipher Machine

The Cynax Cipher Machine is a C++ program that allows authorized developers (Zain, Sharique, and Asad) to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique with different conversation keys (`bhai`, `gamer`, `capstan`).

## Features

- **Login System**: Authenticate users with their name and password.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt messages using a chosen key and decrypt them back.
- **Multiple Cipher Conversations**: Activate specific encryption configurations based on the selected key.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**: User-friendly prompts and outputs guide users through the encryption and decryption processes.

## Caesar Cipher Technique

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this program:
- Lowercase letters (`a-z`) are shifted within the range of lowercase letters.
- Uppercase letters (`A-Z`) are shifted within the range of uppercase letters.
- Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.
